TRAPPIST-1 HABITABILITY ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

TEAM: Team_Alpha
DATE: 2025-12-04
MISSION: Habitable Zone Analysis

======================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================

Based on analysis of TRAPPIST-1 system light curve data, our team
has identified and assessed the three planets within the star's
habitable zone. TRAPPIST-1d shows the highest potential for
Earth-like conditions and possible surface liquid water.

======================================================================
DATA ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Data File: trappist_jwst_data.csv
Data Points: 20,000
Time Range: 0.0 to 60.0 days
Analysis Method: Transit photometry + period folding

Identified Habitable Zone Periods:
  1. 4.05 days (TRAPPIST-1d)
  2. 6.10 days (TRAPPIST-1e)  
  3. 9.21 days (TRAPPIST-1f)

Excluded Periods (non-habitable):
  • 1.51, 2.42 days: Too hot (inner planets b, c)
  • 12.35, 18.77 days: Too cold (outer planets g, h)

======================================================================
HABITABILITY ASSESSMENT
======================================================================

1. TRAPPIST-1d 🌍
   • Orbital Period: 4.05 days
   • Temperature: 15°C (Earth-like!)
   • Habitability Score: 1.00/1.0
   • Assessment: EXCELLENT - Similar temperature to Earth
   • Key Factor: Surface liquid water VERY likely

2. TRAPPIST-1e ❄️
   • Orbital Period: 6.10 days
   • Temperature: -22°C
   • Habitability Score: 0.59/1.0
   • Assessment: GOOD - Could be warmed by atmosphere
   • Key Factor: JWST primary target for atmospheric study

3. TRAPPIST-1f 🧊
   • Orbital Period: 9.21 days
   • Temperature: -54°C
   • Habitability Score: 0.30/1.0
   • Assessment: POSSIBLE - Subsurface ocean potential
   • Key Factor: Ice shell could protect from radiation

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

PRIORITY 1: Atmospheric Study (TRAPPIST-1e)
  • Use JWST transmission spectroscopy
  • Search for CO₂, H₂O, CH₄, O₂ signatures
  • Assess greenhouse warming potential

PRIORITY 2: Surface Characterization (TRAPPIST-1d)
  • Future direct imaging missions
  • Search for ocean glint, vegetation red edge
  • Climate modeling for water cycle

PRIORITY 3: Subsurface Exploration (TRAPPIST-1f)
  • Ice-penetrating radar studies
  • Search for Europa-like subsurface oceans
  • Assess radiation protection capabilities

======================================================================
SCIENTIFIC IMPACT
======================================================================

This analysis contributes to:
  1. Target selection for JWST observations
  2. Understanding red dwarf habitable zones
  3. Multi-planet system dynamics
  4. Biosignature detection strategies

The TRAPPIST-1 system represents our best opportunity to
discover life beyond Earth within the next decade.

======================================================================
TEAM CONCLUSION
======================================================================

We recommend focusing observational resources on TRAPPIST-1e,
as its position in the habitable zone combined with potential
atmospheric warming makes it the most promising candidate for
detecting biosignatures with current technology.

All three habitable zone planets warrant further study and
represent humanity's best chance to answer the fundamental
question: "Are we alone in the universe?"
